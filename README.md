## Overview

This algorithm is designed to calculate possible answers for the crossword puzzle game by Ludobros ([App Store link](https://apps.apple.com/th/developer/ludobros/id871218554?l=th)). The working principle is searching for valid words based on given target lengths, available letters in the crossword grid, and the connections between nodes that represent adjacent letters. It also applies the gameâ€™s gravity rule, where letters fall down to fill empty spaces as words are used, and employs a backtracking approach to efficiently explore all potential solutions.
